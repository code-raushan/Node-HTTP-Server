# A simple HTTP Server

In events of learning HTTP, the protocol, I have implemented a simple HTTP server with the help of official [NodeJS](nodejs.org) docs.

- It makes use of `HTTP` module of Node to create the server.

- Set the listening port and response headers and status codes. 

- (Sidejobs) Digged up ThunderClient extension of VS Code. Believe me, it is at par with the Postman(atleast for meðŸ˜‰).
